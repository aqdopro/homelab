# 🖥️ Server Plans

This note outlines my current ideas and goals for what I want to do with a dedicated server in my homelab.

## 🔧 Server Use Cases

- [ ] 🌐 Host virtual machines (VMs)
- [ ] 📦 Run Docker containers
- [ ] 🧠 Self-host apps (e.g., Home Assistant, Pi-hole, etc.)
- [ ] 💾 Serve as a NAS or connect to a NAS
- [ ] 📽️ Media server (Plex/Jellyfin with hardware transcoding)
- [ ] 🛡️ Firewall or network services (alternate pfSense box?)
- [ ] ☁️ Personal cloud (Nextcloud, Paperless-ngx)
- [ ] 👨‍💻 Lab for learning networking, Linux, scripting
- [ ] 📊 Run monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus, Netdata)
- [ ] 🌍 Access via VPN or Tailscale remotely
- [ ] 🧪 Test environments for VLAN, DNS, and service isolation

## 🧩 Planned Software

- [ ] Proxmox VE
- [ ] Portainer
- [ ] Docker Compose
- [ ] [Jellyfin / Plex](Media_Server)
- [ ] Nextcloud
- [ ] Home Assistant

## 📦 Hardware Plans

- 4+ Bay NAS or separate NAS device
- NVIDIA Quadro P2000 (✅ planned for transcoding)
- 10GbE NIC (RJ45)
- 32GB+ ECC RAM
- Low-power CPU or Intel Xeon (depending on chassis)
